<h1>Why this commit was required</h1>
With the previous commit of MySql to the project, the opportunity to create some interesting developments has arrived. As stated in the previous set of notes for adding MySql to Project; MySql was needed as Redis stores data to memory, and for future-proofing performance a database for holding records <b>in storage</b> was required. This does not make Redis as a database system obsolete, as records held on memory would allow for faster access.
The purpose of this commit is to make the best use of the advantages of both these database systems. A table has been create with MySql which now holds all order records, this will allow for a greater storage of records without affecting performance. Login configuration was also created with this commit, although very basic right now, the login configuration allows for customer orders already in MySql to be moved from MySql to Redis, allowing for greater performance for customers logged into system.
<h1>Where this project will go from here</h1>
As login functionality will advance for this project, accessability in this project will be tidied away. The ability to select and manipulate records via basic curl commands was fine for getting started, however in time these will be tidied away to ensure record manipulation is being performed via secure routes. The hope will be that this will mean the README.md file will also become simplified.
